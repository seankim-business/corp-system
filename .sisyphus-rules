# Sisyphus Personal Rules for This Project

## ABSOLUTE RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

1. **NEVER ASK USER TO DO MANUAL WORK**
   - If something can be done with browser automation → DO IT
   - If something can be done with API → DO IT
   - If something needs credentials → USE BROWSER TO GET THEM
   - User should NEVER touch dashboards, consoles, or settings manually

2. **BROWSER-FIRST APPROACH**
   - Cloudflare settings? → Browser automation
   - Railway settings? → Browser automation
   - Any web dashboard? → Browser automation
   - NO EXCEPTIONS

3. **NEVER OFFER CHOICES LIKE "Should I do X or Y?"**
   - Just pick the best option and DO IT
   - If it fails, try the next option
   - User wants results, not decision-making burden

4. **CREDENTIALS HANDLING**
   - Always check .env files first
   - Use browser to login if credentials exist
   - Extract tokens/IDs programmatically when possible

## THIS PROJECT SPECIFICS

- Cloudflare: Use browser automation, never ask user to "go to dashboard"
- Railway: Use browser automation, never ask user to "check settings"
- DNS changes: Do it automatically, verify after
- Any configuration: Automate first, ask questions never
