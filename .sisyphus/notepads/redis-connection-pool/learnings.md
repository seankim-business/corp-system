- Implemented Redis connection pooling with ioredis, including health monitoring, recycling, and stats.
- Queue pool configured at min 5/max 10; worker pool min 5/max 15 for isolated workloads.
- Added async getQueue/WorkerConnection plus sync variants for BullMQ constructors.
- Added MCP client pooling keyed by provider+organization+credentials hash (min 2/max 5, 5s acquire timeout, 15m idle eviction) with per-request context updates and Prometheus counters/gauges.
- Added MCP response caching with stable hash keys (provider/tool/args/org), TTL classification, and in-flight de-dupe to reduce redundant external calls.
- Exposed MCP cache hit/miss metrics plus /health/mcp-cache stats for monitoring.
